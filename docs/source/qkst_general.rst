==============================================
 Quick Start
==============================================

EnzyHTP is a python library which means it doesn't have any
direct executables but instead provides modular functions as
building blocks of any customized workflow from users. In other
word, user needs to writing a main script calling EnzyHTP functions
to furnish their automated workflow.

Modify from a Template
======================

As a quick-start, we will modify from a main script template
provided under the `/template` folder of EnzyHTP. I will explain
functions used in the template and talk about how they can be modified
to match customized demand from users.

.. note::

    The code below are sections from `template/template_main.py`
