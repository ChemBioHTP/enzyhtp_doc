==============================================

This page aims for providing useful information to get code-lovers/developers to start with EnzyHTP. (instead of reading all the code)
It will introduce the core data structure of EnzyHTP, file I/O & operations wrapping around it,
and the use of science APIs. The module & file architecture of EnzyHTP will also be mentioned here.

We plan to finish this after refactoring EnzyHTP under the new architecture.
